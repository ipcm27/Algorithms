# ðŸ§  Algorithms Training Repository

## Purpose

This repository is dedicated to practicing and reinforcing fundamental algorithmic concepts. It serves as a personal sandbox for exploring classic problems, improving coding fluency, and building a strong foundation in computational thinking.

## Contents

Youâ€™ll find implementations and exercises covering topics such as:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching techniques (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies
- Basic data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists)
- Problem-solving patterns (e.g., sliding window, two pointers)

## Technologies

- Language: Java (mainly), Python

## Usage

Feel free to clone the repo and run the examples locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ipcm27/Algorithms.git
cd Algorithms
